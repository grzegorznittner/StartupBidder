In order to place a bid on the Startupbidder site, you must certify that you are legally able to bid on small company investments in your jurisdiction.  You may be required to be an "accredited investor", "sophisticated investor", "professional investor", or some other term depending on jurisdiction.  Generally it depends on which country you are currently residing in.  Specific rules you must follow concerning applicable countries are included below:

<p>
1. Australia
<br/>
You confirm that you are a "Sophisticated Investor" client as defined in the Corporations Act of Australia.
<br/>
The Corporations Act requires that an offer of securities or debentures needs prospectus disclosure to investors unless excluded in section 708. Along with exclusions for small offerings, subsections 708(8) to 708(20) of the Corporations Act identify certain persons and circumstances as not requiring disclosure, including the following persons:
<br/>
    a &rsquo;sophisticated investor;&rsquo; which is defined where:
<br/>
        the minimum amount payable for securities is at least $500,000; or
<br/>
        the collective amount invested in the same class of securities adds up to $500,000; or
<br/>
        a qualified accountant certifies the net asset worth of $2.5 million or gross income for each of the last two financial years of at least $250,000 per annum.
<br/>
The exemption for &rsquo;sophisticated investors&rsquo; recognises that certain investors are able to protect their own investment interests without regulatory protection.

<br/>
