Your goal here is to present specific relevant detail that can help someone to evaluate your idea.  Picture the life of a typical junior analyst at a venture firm.  They receive dozens, if not hundreds of these startup applications each week.  They have only a short time to glance over each one and see if it merits further investigation.  You want to show that you have a vision, with a definite plan, and the right team to execute it.  Avoid platitudes.  Avoid generalizations.  Talk about your market, your product, your price, your strategy, and just for kicks, how you're going to change the world.
