# project.properties file defines overrides for default.properties

# Explanation: This file should be created by each user as and when he or she needs to override particular values.
# Consequently, it should not be placed under version control.


# Stylesheets
#
# Note: Stylesheets will be concatenated in the order they are listed in the file.stylesheets property (i.e. the last
# file listed will be at the end of the concatenated file), so it probably makes sense to have the main style.css file
# as the first entry
# Example:
# file.stylesheets  = style.css, lightbox.css, plugin.css
#
file.stylesheets  = style.css


# Web Pages
#
# These are the pages (files) that will be served to users (.html, .php, .asp, etc). Files in this property will
# be minified / optimised and have any stylesheet or javascript references updated to the minified examples
#
# The paths need to be relative
#
# Files can be added in a comma separated form
file.pages        = index.html, error-page.html, main-page.html, help-page.html, terms-page.html, contact-page.html, about-page.html, login-page.html, profile-page.html, profile-list-page.html, edit-profile-page.html, new-listing-basics-page.html, new-listing-bmc-page.html, new-listing-qa-page.html, new-listing-financials-page.html, new-listing-media-page.html, nearby-page.html, api-page.html, discover-page.html, notifications-page.html, message-group-page.html, messages-page.html, profile-listing-page.html, company-bids-page.html, company-comments-page.html, company-investor-bids-page.html, company-model-page.html, company-owner-bids-page.html, company-page.html, company-questions-page.html, company-slides-page.html, company-owner-investor-bids-page.html, company-preview-page.html, notification-page.html, active-listing-bmc-page.html, active-listing-qa-page.html, new-listing-documents-page.html, active-listing-documents-page.html, add-listing-page.html, home-page.html, import-listing-page.html, login-page.html


# site manifest for offline
# this is the name of the manifest file you declared in the <html> tag
# Uncomment this line to enable appcache generation:

# Excluded files and dirs
#
# Add any files or directories you add to the project and do not want to be copied to the publish directory as a
# comma separated list
# These files are ignored in addition to the default ones specified in default.properties.
# Example: file.exclude = badfolder/**
file.exclude      = m4/**

# Bypassed JavaScript files and dirs
#
# Add any files or folders within the mylibs directory that you want to be copied to the publish directory as a
# comma separated list
# These files will not be concatenated or minimized and will simply be copied over as is.
# Note: you cannot declare an empty file.bypass property, it would exclude the entire mylibs folder
# Example:
# file.js.bypass = widgets.js, gadgets.js, gidgets.js
#file.js.bypass = startupbidder.js

# options are WHITESPACE_ONLY, SIMPLE_OPTIMIZATIONS, ADVANCED_OPTIMIZATIONS

# Specify an environment to build
#
# By Default, it builds a production environment
# Set to dev if building a development environment
# Set to test if building a test environment

#
# Bypass Optimization for these image files or folders
#
# images.bypass
# If set, these images will not be optimized
# Note: you cannot declare an empty images.bypass property, it would exclude the entire img folder from being optimized
